However, achieving strong\nzero-shot generalization - a hallmark of foundation models in other computer\nvision tasks - remains challenging for stereo matching. We introduce\nFoundationStereo, a foundation model for stereo depth estimation designed to\nachieve strong zero-shot generalization. To this end, we first construct a\nlarge-scale (1M stereo pairs) synthetic training dataset featuring large\ndiversity and high photorealism, followed by an automatic self-curation\npipeline to remove ambiguous samples. We then design a number of network\narchitecture components to enhance scalability, including a side-tuning feature\nbackbone that adapts rich monocular priors from vision foundation models to\nmitigate the sim-to-real gap, and long-range context reasoning for effective\ncost volume filtering. Together, these components lead to strong robustness and\naccuracy across domains, establishing a new standard in zero-shot stereo depth\nestimation.

Our Study 1 results showed the discovery of two factors in our scale,\nwhich we named \"Connection\" and \"Coordination.\" We then evaluated this scale by\nrunning Study 2 (N = 201) where online participants rated a new set of\nhuman-robot interaction videos with our scale and an existing rapport scale\nfrom virtual agents research for comparison. We also validated our scale by\nreplicating a prior in-person human-robot interaction study, Study 3 (N = 44),\nand found that rapport is rated significantly greater when participants\ninteracted with a responsive robot (responsive condition) as opposed to an\nunresponsive robot (unresponsive condition). Results from these studies\ndemonstrate high reliability and validity for the CCR scale, which can be used\nto measure rapport in both first-person and third-person perspectives. We\nencourage the adoption of this scale in future studies to measure rapport in a\nvariety of human-robot interactions.\n","authors":["Ting-Han Lin","Hannah Dinner","Tsz Long Leung","Bilge Mutlu","J.

However, the kinematic model suffers from complex motions\n(e.g., wheel slippage, lateral movement) in the case of skid-steering robots\nparticularly because this robot model rotates by skidding its wheels.\nFurthermore, these errors change nonlinearly when the wheel slippage is large\n(e.g., drifting) and are subject to terrain-dependent parameters. To\nsimultaneously tackle point cloud degeneration and the kinematic model errors,\nwe developed a LiDAR-IMU-wheel odometry algorithm incorporating online training\nof a neural network that learns the kinematic model of wheeled robots with\nnonlinearity.

This study makes three major contributions by delving deeply into\ndense correspondence priors to provide existing frameworks with explicit\ngeometric constraints. The first novelty is a contextual-geometric depth\nconsistency loss, which employs depth maps triangulated from dense\ncorrespondences based on estimated ego-motion to guide the learning of depth\nperception from contextual information, since explicitly triangulated depth\nmaps capture accurate relative distances among pixels. The second novelty\narises from the observation that there exists an explicit, deducible\nrelationship between optical flow divergence and depth gradient. A differential\nproperty correlation loss is, therefore, designed to refine depth estimation\nwith a specific emphasis on local variations. The third novelty is a\nbidirectional stream co-adjustment strategy that enhances the interaction\nbetween rigid and optical flows, encouraging the former towards more accurate\ncorrespondence and making the latter more adaptable across various scenarios\nunder the static scene hypotheses.

To solve the 2D non-feature based SLAM problem in large-scale\nenvironments more accurately and efficiently, we propose the grid-based submap\njoining method. Specifically, we first formulate the 2D grid-based submap\njoining problem as a non-linear least squares (NLLS) form to optimize the\nglobal occupancy map and local submap frames simultaneously. We then prove that\nin solving the NLLS problem using Gauss-Newton (GN) method, the increments of\nthe poses in each iteration are independent of the occupancy values of the\nglobal occupancy map. Based on this property, we propose a poseonly GN\nalgorithm equivalent to full GN method to solve the NLLS problem.

To address this limitation, we propose\nTemporal Preference Optimization (TPO), a novel post-training framework\ndesigned to enhance the temporal grounding capabilities of video-LMMs through\npreference learning. TPO adopts a self-training approach that enables models to\ndifferentiate between well-grounded and less accurate temporal responses by\nleveraging curated preference datasets at two granularities: localized temporal\ngrounding, which focuses on specific video segments, and comprehensive temporal\ngrounding, which captures extended temporal dependencies across entire video\nsequences. By optimizing on these preference datasets, TPO significantly\nenhances temporal understanding while reducing reliance on manually annotated\ndata. Extensive experiments on three long-form video understanding\nbenchmarks--LongVideoBench, MLVU, and Video-MME--demonstrate the effectiveness\nof TPO across two state-of-the-art video-LMMs. Notably, LLaVA-Video-TPO\nestablishes itself as the leading 7B model on the Video-MME benchmark,\nunderscoring the potential of TPO as a scalable and efficient solution for\nadvancing temporal reasoning in long-form video understanding.

To avoid these situations,\na non-entanglement constraint can be considered in the motion planning problem\nfor tethered robots.

Research Questions: Is it\npossible to improve the model accuracy by introducing a mathematical model of\nthe ankle strategies by coordinating the heel-strike and toe-off strategies\nwith the CoM movement? Our solution consists of closed-form equations that plan\nhuman-like trajectories for the CoM, the foot swing, and the ankle strategies.\nWe have tested our model by extracting the biomechanics data and postural\nduring locomotion from the motion capture trajectories of 12 healthy subjects\nat 3 self-selected speeds to generate a virtual subject using our model. Our\nvirtual subject has been based on the average of the collected data. The model\noutput shows our virtual subject has walking trajectories that have their\nfeatures consistent with our motion capture data. Additionally, it emerged from\nthe data analysis that our model regulates the stance phase of the foot as\nhumans do. The model proves that locomotion can be modelled as an attractor\ndynamics, proving the existence of a nonlinear map that our nervous system\nlearns. It can support a deeper investigation of locomotion motor control,\npotentially improving locomotion rehabilitation and assistive technologies.\n","authors":["Carlo Tiseo","Ming Jeat Foo","Kalyana C Veluvolu","Arturo Forner-Cordero","Wei Tech Ang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.03498v7.pdf","comment":null}]},"2025-01-28T00:00:00Z":{"Robotics":[{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18393v3","updated":"2025-01-28T17:36:51Z","published":"2024-02-28T15:13:33Z","title":"Decictor: Towards Evaluating the Robustness of Decision-Making in\n  Autonomous Driving Systems","summary":"  Autonomous Driving System (ADS) testing is crucial in ADS development, with\nthe current primary focus being on safety. However, the evaluation of\nnon-safety-critical performance, particularly the ADS's ability to make optimal\ndecisions and produce optimal paths for autonomous vehicles (AVs), is also\nvital to ensure the intelligence and reduce risks of AVs. Currently, there is\nlittle work dedicated to assessing the robustness of ADSs' path-planning\ndecisions (PPDs), i.e., whether an ADS can maintain the optimal PPD after an\ninsignificant change in the environment. The key challenges include the lack of\nclear oracles for assessing PPD optimality and the difficulty in searching for\nscenarios that lead to non-optimal PPDs. To fill this gap, in this paper, we\nfocus on evaluating the robustness of ADSs' PPDs and propose the first method,\nDecictor, for generating non-optimal decision scenarios (NoDSs), where the ADS\ndoes not plan optimal paths for AVs. Decictor comprises three main components:\nNon-invasive Mutation, Consistency Check, and Feedback. To overcome the oracle\nchallenge, Non-invasive Mutation is devised to implement conservative\nmodifications, ensuring the preservation of the original optimal path in the\nmutated scenarios. Subsequently, the Consistency Check is applied to determine\nthe presence of non-optimal PPDs by comparing the driving paths in the original\nand mutated scenarios. To deal with the challenge of large environment space,\nwe design Feedback metrics that integrate spatial and temporal dimensions of\nthe AV's movement. These metrics are crucial for effectively steering the\ngeneration of NoDSs. We evaluate Decictor on Baidu Apollo, an open-source and\nproduction-grade ADS. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of\nDecictor in detecting non-optimal PPDs of ADSs.\n","authors":["Mingfei Cheng","Yuan Zhou","Xiaofei Xie","Junjie Wang","Guozhu Meng","Kairui Yang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18393v3.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07688v2","updated":"2025-01-28T16:02:30Z","published":"2024-10-10T07:54:17Z","title":"PokeFlex: A Real-World Dataset of Volumetric Deformable Objects for\n  Robotics","summary":"  Data-driven methods have shown great potential in solving challenging\nmanipulation tasks; however, their application in the domain of deformable\nobjects has been constrained, in part, by the lack of data.

Achieving autonomy in robotic\nsurgery, which entails the ability to reason and adapt to changes in the\nenvironment, remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose a\nmulti-modal LLM integration in robot-assisted surgery for autonomous blood\nsuction. The reasoning and prioritization are delegated to the higher-level\ntask-planning LLM, and the motion planning and execution are handled by the\nlower-level deep reinforcement learning model, creating a distributed agency\nbetween the two components.

Multiple industrial robots are\ncuspidal. They tend to have a beautiful mechanical design, but they pose path\nplanning challenges. A task-space path may have a valid IK solution for each\npoint along the path, but a continuous joint-space path may depend on the\nchoice of the IK solution or even be infeasible. This paper presents new\nanalysis, path planning, and optimization methods to enhance the utility of\ncuspidal robots. We first demonstrate an efficient method to identify cuspidal\nrobots and show, for the first time, that the ABB GoFa and certain robots with\nthree parallel joint axes are cuspidal. We then propose a new path planning\nmethod for cuspidal robots by finding all IK solutions for each point along a\ntask-space path and constructing a graph to connect each vertex corresponding\nto an IK solution. Graph edges are weighted based on the optimization metric,\nsuch as minimizing joint velocity. The optimal feasible path is the shortest\npath in the graph. This method can find non-singular paths as well as smooth\npaths which pass through singularities. Finally, this path planning method is\nincorporated into a path optimization algorithm.

The learning objective is to achieve\ndesired positions from random initial conditions while adhering to both\ntransient and steady-state performance specifications. This objective is\nchallenging for conventional one-stage end-to-end reinforcement learning, due\nto the strong coupling between position and orientation dynamics, the\ncomplexity in designing and tuning the reward function, and poor sample\nefficiency, which necessitates substantial computational resources and leads to\nextended convergence times. To address these challenges, this work decomposes\nthe learning objective into a three-stage curriculum that incrementally\nincreases task complexity. The curriculum begins with learning to achieve\nstable hovering from a fixed initial condition, followed by progressively\nintroducing randomization in initial positions, orientations and velocities. A\nnovel additive reward function is proposed, to incorporate transient and\nsteady-state performance specifications. The results demonstrate that the\nProximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based curriculum learning approach, coupled\nwith the proposed reward structure, achieves superior performance compared to a\nsingle-stage PPO-trained policy with the same reward function, while\nsignificantly reducing computational resource requirements and convergence\ntime.

The path planning ability of a\nrobot depends on the identification of the traversability of global and local\nground areas. In real-world scenarios, the complexity of outdoor open\nenvironments makes it difficult for robots to identify the traversability of\nground areas that lack a clearly defined structure. Moreover, most existing\nmethods have rarely analyzed the integration of local and global traversability\nidentifications in unstructured outdoor scenarios. To address this problem, we\npropose a novel method, Dual-BEV Nav, first introducing Bird's Eye View (BEV)\nrepresentations into local planning to generate high-quality traversable paths.\nThen, these paths are projected onto the global traversability map generated by\nthe global BEV planning model to obtain the optimal waypoints. By integrating\nthe traversability from both local and global BEV, we establish a dual-layer\nBEV heuristic planning paradigm, enabling long-distance navigation in\nunstructured outdoor environments. We test our approach through both public\ndataset evaluations and real-world robot deployments, yielding promising\nresults. Compared to baselines, the Dual-BEV Nav improved temporal distance\nprediction accuracy by up to $18.7\\%$. In the real-world deployment, under\nconditions significantly different from the training set and with notable\nocclusions in the global BEV, the Dual-BEV Nav successfully achieved a\n65-meter-long outdoor navigation.

We also\nintroduce a novel sampling method to mitigate the suboptimality caused by an\nincorrect world model in the early stages of training, combining it with the\naforementioned technique to achieve a normalised score comparable to other\nstate-of-the-art model-based RL algorithms using only a 7 million trainable\nparameter world model. This model is accessible and can be trained on an\noff-the-shelf laptop.

While previous techniques have predominantly\nrelied on learning latent dynamics through demonstrations, typically\nrepresented as either particles or images, there exists a pertinent limitation:\nacquiring suitable demonstrations, especially for long-horizon tasks, can be\nelusive. Moreover, basing learning entirely on demonstrations can hamper the\nmodel's ability to generalize beyond the demonstrated tasks. In this work, we\nintroduce a demonstration-free hierarchical planning approach capable of\ntackling intricate long-horizon tasks without necessitating any training. We\nemploy large language models (LLMs) to articulate a high-level, stage-by-stage\nplan corresponding to a specified task.

For wheeled robots, a wheel\nkinematic model (i.e., wheel odometry) can improve the reliability of the\nodometry estimation. However, the kinematic model suffers from complex motions\n(e.g., wheel slippage, lateral movement) in the case of skid-steering robots\nparticularly because this robot model rotates by skidding its wheels.\nFurthermore, these errors change nonlinearly when the wheel slippage is large\n(e.g., drifting) and are subject to terrain-dependent parameters. To\nsimultaneously tackle point cloud degeneration and the kinematic model errors,\nwe developed a LiDAR-IMU-wheel odometry algorithm incorporating online training\nof a neural network that learns the kinematic model of wheeled robots with\nnonlinearity. We propose to train the neural network online on a factor graph\nalong with robot states, allowing the learning-based kinematic model to adapt\nto the current terrain condition.

However, manipulating granular materials such as beans,\nnuts, and rice, remains challenging due to the intricate physics of particle\ninteractions, high-dimensional and partially observable state, inability to\nvisually track individual particles in a pile, and the computational demands of\naccurate dynamics prediction. Current deep latent dynamics models often\nstruggle to generalize in granular material manipulation due to a lack of\ninductive biases. In this work, we propose a novel approach that learns a\nvisual dynamics model over Gaussian splatting representations of scenes and\nleverages this model for manipulating granular media via Model-Predictive\nControl. Our method enables efficient optimization for complex manipulation\ntasks on piles of granular media. We evaluate our approach in both simulated\nand real-world settings, demonstrating its ability to solve unseen planning\ntasks and generalize to new environments in a zero-shot transfer. We also show\nsignificant prediction and manipulation performance improvements compared to\nexisting granular media manipulation methods.\n","authors":["Wei-Cheng Tseng","Ellina Zhang","Krishna Murthy Jatavallabhula","Florian Shkurti"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.09740v2.pdf","comment":"project website https://weichengtseng.github.io/gs-granular-mani/"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15071v2","updated":"2025-02-01T06:49:44Z","published":"2025-01-25T04:33:43Z","title":"Gaze-based Task Decomposition for Robot Manipulation in Imitation\n  Learning","summary":"  In imitation learning for robotic manipulation, decomposing object\nmanipulation tasks into multiple sub-tasks is essential. This decomposition\nenables the reuse of learned skills in varying contexts and the combination of\nacquired skills to perform novel tasks, rather than merely replicating\ndemonstrated motions. Gaze plays a critical role in human object manipulation,\nwhere it is strongly correlated with hand movements. We hypothesize that an\nimitating agent's gaze control, fixating on specific landmarks and\ntransitioning between them, simultaneously segments demonstrated manipulations\ninto sub-tasks. In this study, we propose a simple yet robust task\ndecomposition method based on gaze transitions. The method leverages\nteleoperation, a common modality in robotic manipulation for collecting\ndemonstrations, in which a human operator's gaze is measured and used for task\ndecomposition as a substitute for an imitating agent's gaze. Notably, our\nmethod achieves consistent task decomposition across all demonstrations for\neach task, which is desirable in contexts such as machine learning. We applied\nthis method to demonstrations of various tasks and evaluated the\ncharacteristics and consistency of the resulting sub-tasks. Furthermore,\nthrough extensive testing across a wide range of hyperparameter variations, we\ndemonstrated that the proposed method possesses the robustness necessary for\napplication to different robotic systems.\n","authors":["Ryo Takizawa","Yoshiyuki Ohmura","Yasuo Kuniyoshi"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.15071v2.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19499v2","updated":"2025-02-01T06:32:46Z","published":"2024-09-29T00:55:20Z","title":"FastUMI: A Scalable and Hardware-Independent Universal Manipulation\n  Interface with Dataset","summary":"  Real-world manipulation data involving robotic arms is crucial for developing\ngeneralist action policies, yet such data remains scarce since existing data\ncollection methods are hindered by high costs, hardware dependencies, and\ncomplex setup requirements.

Moreover,\nrobotic training data often consists of noisy trajectories, in which each\naction is noisy but executing a series of actions results in a meaningful robot\nmovement. This further makes it difficult for the value function to understand\nthe effect of individual actions. To address this, we introduce Coarse-to-fine\nQ-Network with Action Sequence (CQN-AS), a novel value-based RL algorithm that\nlearns a critic network that outputs Q-values over a sequence of actions, i.e.,\nexplicitly training the value function to learn the consequence of executing\naction sequences.

However, such predictive models, often called world\nmodels, remains challenging to learn and are typically developed for\ntask-specific solutions with online policy learning. To unlock world models'\ntrue potential, we argue that they should 1) be trainable on offline,\npre-collected trajectories, 2) support test-time behavior optimization, and 3)\nfacilitate task-agnostic reasoning. To this end, we present DINO World Model\n(DINO-WM), a new method to model visual dynamics without reconstructing the\nvisual world. DINO-WM leverages spatial patch features pre-trained with DINOv2,\nenabling it to learn from offline behavioral trajectories by predicting future\npatch features. This allows DINO-WM to achieve observational goals through\naction sequence optimization, facilitating task-agnostic planning by treating\ngoal features as prediction targets. We demonstrate that DINO-WM achieves\nzero-shot behavioral solutions at test time on six environments without expert\ndemonstrations, reward modeling, or pre-learned inverse models, outperforming\nprior state-of-the-art work across diverse task families such as arbitrarily\nconfigured mazes, push manipulation with varied object shapes, and\nmulti-particle scenarios.\n","authors":["Gaoyue Zhou","Hengkai Pan","Yann LeCun","Lerrel Pinto"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.04983v2.pdf","comment":null}]}}
